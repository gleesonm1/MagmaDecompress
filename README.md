# MagmaDecompress

This repository presents two functions that can be used to calculate the volatile content of a magma during isentropic decompression, and the influence of this decompression on the volatile contents recorded in melt embayments. These codes are presented alongside Gleeson et al. (in prep).

All code is written for MATLAB R2018b.

To run Decompress.m the user will also need access to the alphaMELTS for MATLAB packages. Please contact Paula Antoshechkin for more details.
